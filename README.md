#1. Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
I developed TrackFit with the primary goal of helping users track their daily weight, set personal weight goals, and monitor their progress over time. The app was designed to address the need for a user friendly tool that allows users to log their weight consistently and stay motivated by visualizing their progress toward their fitness goals.

#2. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The necessary screens for the TrackFit app included a login screen, and a screen for daily weight entries. The login screen allows the user to create an account or login with their existing account. The next screen implements the goal-setting and daily weight entries with the ability to delete weight entries and log out. Another feature that I implemented into the app is an SMS feature that notifies the uses via text message that they have reached their weight goal. These features I designed with the user in mind to ensure a clean, intuitive layout and straightforward navigation. 

#3. How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
My approach to coding the TrackFit app was strategical and modular, focusing on separating functionalities into distinct classes and methods. I also prioritized error handling and input validation to make sure the app could handle unexpected inputs and maintain stability. These techniques helped keep the code organized and reliable, which will also be applied to future projects to enhance code quality and ease of maintenance.

#4. How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested the app using manual testing and virtual emulators, simulating various user interactions to verify functionality across different scenarios. This testing process revealed bugs, such as the app crashing when a weight was added without a date. Identifying and fixing these issues during testing was critical for delivering a stable and user-friendly app.

#5. Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
One of the challenges for me was maintaining a balance between functionality and simplicity in the user interface. I had to innovate by designing the UI to be as straightforward as possible while still providing all necessary features. This included implementing clear input fields and validation so that the TrackFit app is both easy to use and effective in helping users achieve their goals.

#6. In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was particularly successful in the implementation of the goal-setting and weight entry features. These components required a deep understanding of both UI design and database management. Successfully integrating these features demonstrated my ability to apply my knowledge and skills in mobile app development to create a practical, user-centered weight tracking tool.
